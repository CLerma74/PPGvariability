Database with mean and standard deviation of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) of photoplethysmography (PPG) morphological parameters evaluated from 40 legs of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). This database include demographic and clinical data for patients. Ankle brachial index (ABI) is included to classify if the leg had a normal or an altered ABI. Data used for the manuscript: Title: Assessment of the dynamic behaviour of PPG morphological time series from peripheral artery disease using recurrence quantification analysis By: David Hernández Obín, Gertrudis Hortensia González Gómez, Adriana Torres Machorro and Claudia Lerma.
